# Rotary encoder

A rotary encoder is a type of position sensor that converts the angular position (rotation) of a knob into an output signal that can be used to determine which direction the knob is turned.

## Rotary encoder pinout

**GND** is the ground connection.

**VCC** is the positive supply voltage, which is typically between 3.3 and 5 volts.

**SW** is the output of the push button switch (active low). When the knob is depressed, the voltage goes LOW.

**DT (Output B)** is similar to CLK output, but it lags behind CLK by a 90° phase shift. This output is used to determine the direction of rotation.

**CLK (Output A)** is the primary output pulse used to determine the amount of rotation. Each time the knob is turned in either direction by just one detent (click), the ‘CLK’ output goes through one cycle of going HIGH and then LOW

## Count configuration:

In order to calculate the distance that the wheel is moving, we will use an optical rotary encoder to count the pulses that occur during rotation.

The encoder consists of Slits or openings where if any of the pins A and B pass over them it signals High and it increases the count. 

Moreover,  the encoder has 2 pins in order to have a higher resolution of the movement and in order to determine the direction that the wheel for example is moving either clockwise or anti-clockwise  .

# Code

---

To count the pulses from the encoder, we can use interrupts in our code to detect changes in the A and B pins. Each time a pulse is detected, we can increment a counter to keep track of the total number of pulses. We can then use this count to calculate the distance traveled by the wheel based on the encoder's resolution and the wheel's circumference.

- Firstly we will define the pins 2 , 3 on the Arduino Uno board and use them as our interrupts and  initialize the count variable to 0.

  

```arduino
#define PIN_ENCODER_A 2
#define PIN_ENCODER_B 3

long long  counter  = 0;
```

- We will define the clockwise movement as positive (incrementing the count ) and the anti clockwise as negative (decrementing the count ).

- if we assume that pin A is at the top of pin B, then if pin A signals high first and Pin B is still low it means that the encoder is moving in clockwise direction and add to the count ,otherwise decrement the count.(opposite signals w.r.t Pin A)

```arduino
void ISR_encoderPinA()
{
  if(digitalRead(PIN_ENCODER_A)!=digitalRead(PIN_ENCODER_B))
    counter++;
   else
    counter--;
}
```

- On the other hand , if pin A is low and we check Pin B is High , it means that the encoder is moving anti-clockwise decrement from the count .(same signals w.r.t Pin B).

```arduino
void ISR_encoderPinB()
{
  if(digitalRead(PIN_ENCODER_A)==digitalRead(PIN_ENCODER_B))
    counter++;
   else
    counter--;
}
```

- then we assign both pins as input on the Arduino board and attach the interrupt for both pins with ISR code to execute when a CHANGE in the Signal from High to Low or vice versa.

```arduino
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
Serial.begin(9600);
pinMode(PIN_ENCODER_A,INPUT_PULLUP);
pinMode(PIN_ENCODER_B,INPUT_PULLUP);

attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(PIN_ENCODER_A),ISR_encoderPinA,CHANGE);
attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(PIN_ENCODER_B),ISR_encoderPinB,CHANGE);

}
```

- then print the counter in the loop function.

```arduino
void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

  Serial.print("Counter: ");
  Serial.println(counter);

}
```

# LPF & cutoff frequency

To design a low-pass filter with the proper cutoff frequency (fc) for WALL-E, we need to consider the maximum speed of WALL-E, the number of encoder pulses per revolution, and the diameter of the wheel with the encoder.

- Maximum Speed of WALL-E = 0.5 m/s
- Diameter of the wheel with the encoder = 40 cm = 0.4 m

Circumference of the wheel = π * diameter
= π * 0.4 m
= 1.265m

Number of pulses per second = Number of pulses per revolution * Revolutions per second

To find the revolutions per second, we can divide the maximum speed by the distance traveled in one revolution:
Revolutions per second = Maximum Speed / Circumference of the wheel
= 0.5 m/s / 1.265 m/rev
= 0.397 rev/s

Number of pulses per second = 540 pulses/rev * 0.397 rev/s
= 214.38 pulses/s So the cutoff frequency should be higher than the number of pulses per second but not too high to avoid noise.
